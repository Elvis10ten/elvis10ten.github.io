There are currently ~2.5 billion Android devices — consisting of ~1,300 discrete brands and ~24,000 unique device models. I'm exploring tapping into this latent resource pool to make automated testing affordable & unlock a more comprehensive configuration coverage.

The goal of DART (Distributed Android Remote Testing) is to enable any Android device to run automated tests — without ADB or complex setups/maintenance. A commercial product could pay people per hour of device use, allowing anyone to utilize idle device time. Each device is subsumed to provide a distributed testbed.

DART is orthogonal to [crowdsourced testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourced_testing) — the latter requires active human participation.

DART seems to be the best solution to utilize device idle time — the best way to verify that an app works on "Samsung S9" is by executing it on "Samsung S9".  Contrast this to other procedures where phones are usually a suboptimal option: server hosting, remote computation, etc.

In the demo below, I ran a few test cases on [Mozilla Focus Privacy Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.focus&hl=en_US&gl=US) without cables/ADB.

### 1.1. 💪 Motivation

The following problems motivated the development of DART.

##### i. 🧩 Android Device Fragmentation

<img class="fit_image" src="./assets/android_fragmentation.gif" alt="Android device fragmentation" />

The top device farms barely cover 1% of the total number of Android device models. Nondistributed device farms favor depth instead of breadth — maintenance cost increases as more diverse devices are added.

Testing on flagship devices alone doesn't always suffice.
>Anecdote: I once spent an entire day debugging an ANR that occurs to a small fraction of our users. I discovered it only affects phones purchased in specific regions. I never was able to reproduce the issue on the same phone bought in the USA.

The Android version distribution exacerbates this problem.

![Android OS Distribution](./assets/android_os_distribution.png)

[Headspin](https://www.headspin.io/) aims to alleviate some of these issues. They claim to have a global infrastructure of more than 22,000 SIM-enabled (similar) devices in 150 locations. A big plus as traditional services (like Firebase Testlabs) can't handle geographical concerns. At Headspin's core is the [DeviceFarmer STF](https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf) open-source library. But like its predecessors, Headspin only supports a limited set of device models.

##### ii. 💸 Expensive Physical Devices

<img class="fit_image" src="./assets/real_device_pricing_chart.svg" />

Real device test farms have an initial cost and require periodic maintenance, hence why they are more expensive than virtual device farms.

> Running 10 hours of test daily on real devices costs **$1000/month** (assuming 20 working days of equal levels of productivity).

### 1.2. 📱 Product

**The key 🔑:** Uber averts enormous maintenance costs by not owning all the cars on its global network. Similarly, with a distributed network of test devices, extensive device coverage is attainable with minimal maintenance costs. For one or two co-located devices, maintenance isn't fastidious.

> From [DeviceFramer STF](https://github.com/DeviceFarmer/stf#faq) FAQ: "Aside from a single early failure we had within only a few months, all of our devices were doing fine for about two years. However, having reached the 2-3 year mark, several devices have started to experience visibly expanded batteries [...]
In our experience, the system runs just fine most of the time, and any issues are mostly USB-related. You'll usually have to do something about once a week."

Organizations can decide what type of tests are ideal for DART and if the network is made-up of single nodes or clusters of nodes. The simple taxonomy of android testing below should be helpful. [1]

<img class="full_width_image" src="./assets/taxonomy_android_testing.svg" alt="Taxonomy of Android testing" />

The network can be internal to an organization. An example: `X` devices stored in HQ, each employee can remotely contribute their test device into the system.

It can also be external to an organization. Imagine paying people `$1.5/hour` of device time. Assuming a device runs test overnight (thanks to timezone differences), the estimated monthly earning is `$240` (`$1.5 * 8 hours * 20 working days`).

> The median income in some countries is ~$400/month. 

Below is a demo of the [proof-of-concept](https://github.com/Elvis10ten/dart).

<div class="video_wrapper">
    <iframe class="video_frame" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7SotlhlwMDA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Currently, a simple dashboard renders the test summary.

<div class="image_row">
  <div class="dual_image_column">
    <img src="./assets/dashboard_timeline.png" alt="Dashboard timeline" style="width:100%" />
  </div>
  <div class="dual_image_column">
    <img src="./assets/dashboard_screenshots.png" alt="Dashboard screenshots" style="width:100%" />
  </div>
</div>

### 1.3. 🛡️ Security

![Network of devices](./assets/network_of_devices.png)

There are two perspectives here:

##### i. 🧐 End-user Perspective

The end-user is concerned about malignant binaries & privacy.

Security checks will guard devices from malicious binaries. The system will be closed — only verified publishers allowed. GooglePlay is leveraged to enforce package name and signature correspondence.

A sandboxed test environment guarantees that private data is inaccessible to apps under test.

[![Android Enterprise security](./assets/android_enterpise_security.jpg)](https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/android-enterprise-security-assessed-gartner/)

##### ii. 👩🏽‍💻 Publisher Perspective

The publisher cares about test fraud and product leaks.

Proof of work disincentivizes test fraud. The server can use device logs, screenshots, videos with UUID, and past executions to validate submitted work results. As this isn't watertight, it is best combined with other strategies: user verifications, [device attestation](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet), randomization, and device throughput throttling.

Preventing product leaks is hard  — if it runs on a phone, any sufficiently motivated (& knowledgeable) person can figure out a way to access objects. Three good-enough solutions are:

a. Running headless tests.

b. Using a private network of vetted devices.

c. Adopting only for binaries at the later end of the release pipeline.

### 1.4. 🎃 Going Headless

It is possible to obscure the application under test using a simple overlay. The video below shows the execution of the test cases of the Google IO 2019 app. On the right, the app interactions are invisible. Depending on the strategy, concealing actions do not affect screenshots or videos.

<div class="video_wrapper">
    <iframe class="video_frame" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxwsoe3T8yE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

With framework UI component wrappers, it is possible to borrow some ideas from [Layoutlib](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/4db1f432b853152075923499768639e14403b73a/tools/layoutlib/README) to offer a full headless solution. `Layoutlib` is a custom version of the android View framework designed to run inside Eclipse. The goal of the library is to provide layout rendering in Eclipse that are very close to their rendering on devices.

### 1.5. 📦 Containerization

Tests need to run in an isolated environment. A plugin framework like [VirtualAPK](https://github.com/didi/VirtualAPK) can be built to offer a layer of isolation between apps and the OS. This works using the `DexClassLoader` and some reflection hacks to modify framework components. With this approach, apps can be seamlessly loaded & unloaded without any user interaction.

![VirtualAPK](./assets/virtual_apk_diagram.png)

> The [GooglePlay dynamic feature delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/play-feature-delivery) system uses some of these reflection techniques to support legacy devices (pre Android 7.0) 🙈. For instance, `addAssetPath` is called via reflection to make resources not bundled in an APK available for use.
![Splitcompat source](./assets/split_compat_source.png)

This plugin approach adds cruft that is nonexistent on a regular device. An alternative is using the [Android work profile](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-profiles). Work profile creates a separate, self-contained profile on Android devices that isolates corporate data from personal apps and data. [3]

<a href="https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/work-profile-new-standard-employee-privacy/"><img class="fit_image" src="./assets/android_work_profiles.gif" alt="Android work profile" /></a>

Work profiles also provide always-on VPN configuration, control of runtime permissions, extra security, etc. Work profiles are a great fit, only deviating slightly from the operating mode used by the average user.

> Android allows apps signed with the same key to run in the same process, if the apps so request, so that the system treats them as a single application. [3]

### 1.6. 💔 Flakiness
The system should eliminate most causes of flakiness that results from running tests on real peoples' devices — I have run over **5,000 tests** so far without any issues 🚀. In an external network, it would be naive to assume perfection as there are so many variables introduced. As the project evolves, these issues would be identified and mitigated.

A few researchers manually examined **423** projects featuring the Espresso automated GUI testing tool. They derived a set of **27** different causes of modifications and grouped them into **nine** macro-categories. Category percentages were then computed based on the frequency of modification causes. [2]

<img class="full_width_image" src="./assets/graphic_taxonomy_of_modification_causes.svg" />

### 1.7. 🚧 Code Repository

There are four primary directories in the [Github repo](https://github.com/Elvis10ten/dart):

i. `Apollo`: Android project for the client (worker).

ii. `WorkServer`: Kotlin project for the gRPC work server.

iii. `WorkSpecs`: Protobuf definitions shared by both the server & Android client.

iv. `Dashboard`: React project for the web dashboard.

All projects are still a work in progress and lack adequate documentation.

## 2. 🏗️ System Overview

The next few sections cover individual system components. For the sake of brevity, I exclude codes that are irrelevant to the topic at hand. For each component, I only focus on some key ideas. You can always explore the [Github repo](https://github.com/Elvis10ten/dart) for the full source code.

## 3. 🤖 UiAutomator

The framework's `UiAutomation` can't be used when tests aren't run traditionally. Fortunately, the functionalities of `UiAutomation` can be replicated using the platform `Accessibility APIs` and some other functionally equivalent alternatives. As evident from the documentation, `UiAutomation` can be viewed as an `AccessiblityService` with extras.

```java:title=android.app.UiAutomation.java
/**
 * Class for interacting with the device's UI by simulation user actions and
 * introspection of the screen content. It relies on the platform accessibility
 * APIs to introspect the screen and to perform some actions on the remote view
 * tree. It also allows injecting of arbitrary raw input events simulating user
 * interaction with keyboards and touch devices. One can think of a UiAutomation
 * as a special type of {@link android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService}
 * which does not provide hooks for the service life cycle and exposes other
 * APIs that are useful for UI test automation.
 * <p>
 * The APIs exposed by this class are low-level to maximize flexibility when
 * developing UI test automation tools and libraries. Generally, a UiAutomation
 * client should be using a higher-level library or implement high-level functions.
 * For example, performing a tap on the screen requires construction and injecting
 * of a touch down and up events which have to be delivered to the system by a
 * call to {@link #injectInputEvent(InputEvent, boolean)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The APIs exposed by this class operate across applications enabling a client
 * to write tests that cover use cases spanning over multiple applications. For
 * example, going to the settings application to change a setting and then
 * interacting with another application whose behavior depends on that setting.
 * </p>
 */
public final class UiAutomation {
}
```

The alternative `UiAutomation` (internal) server can be implemented like this:

```kotlin:title=UiAutomationServer.kt
class UiAutomationServer(
    private val screenRotator: ScreenRotator,
    private val screenViewer: ScreenViewer,
    private val appPermissioner: AppPermissioner
): AutomationServer.Stub() {

    var lastAccessibilityEvent: AccessibilityEvent? = null
    var accessibilityEventListener: OnAccessibilityEventListener? = null

    fun onAccessibilityEvent(event: AccessibilityEvent) {
        lastAccessibilityEvent = event

        val uiEvent = addUiEvent(event)
        accessibilityEventListener?.onAccessibilityEvent(uiEvent)
    }

    override fun setOnAccessibilityEventListener(listener: OnAccessibilityEventListener?) {
        accessibilityEventListener = listener
    }

    override fun findFocus(focus: Int) =
        runWithOriginalIdentity { AutomationService.INSTANCE?.findFocus(focus) }

    override fun performGlobalAction(action: Int) =
        runWithOriginalIdentity { AutomationService.INSTANCE?.performGlobalAction(action) ?: false }

    override fun getLastEvent() = lastAccessibilityEvent

    override fun setRotation(rotation: Int) =
        runWithOriginalIdentity { screenRotator.setRotation(rotation) }

    override fun unfreezeCurrentRotation() =
        runWithOriginalIdentity { screenRotator.unfreezeCurrentRotation() }

    override fun freezeCurrentRotation() =
        runWithOriginalIdentity { screenRotator.freezeCurrentRotation() }


    override fun restoreInitialRotation() =
        runWithOriginalIdentity { screenRotator.restoreInitialSettings() }

    override fun getWindows(): List<AccessibilityWindowInfo> =
        runWithOriginalIdentity { AutomationService.INSTANCE?.windows ?: emptyList() }

    override fun findAccessibilityNodeInfosByText(nodeInfo: UiNodeInfo, text: String): List<UiNodeInfo> {
        return try {
            nodeInfo.accessibilityNodeInfo.findAccessibilityNodeInfosByText(text).map {
                addUiNodeInfo(it)
            }
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            Timber.e(e)
            emptyList()
        }
    }

    override fun findAccessibilityNodeInfosByViewId(nodeInfo: UiNodeInfo, viewId: String): List<UiNodeInfo> {
        return try {
            nodeInfo.accessibilityNodeInfo.findAccessibilityNodeInfosByViewId(viewId).map {
                addUiNodeInfo(it)
            }
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            Timber.e(e)
            emptyList()
        }
    }

    override fun performNodeAction(nodeInfo: UiNodeInfo, action: Int): Boolean {
        return nodeInfo.accessibilityNodeInfo.performAction(action)
    }

    override fun getUiEventSource(event: UiEvent): UiNodeInfo? {
        return event.accessibilityEvent.source?.let { addUiNodeInfo(it) }
    }

    override fun getRootInActiveWindow() =
        runWithOriginalIdentity { AutomationService.INSTANCE?.rootInActiveWindow }

    override fun getServiceInfo() =
        runWithOriginalIdentity { AutomationService.INSTANCE?.serviceInfo }

    override fun setServiceInfo(serviceInfo: AccessibilityServiceInfo): Boolean {
        return runWithOriginalIdentity {
            AutomationService.INSTANCE?.let {
                // TODO: Security on ServiceInfo from clients. This maybe should be validated/restricted.
                it.serviceInfo = serviceInfo
                return@runWithOriginalIdentity true
            }

            return@runWithOriginalIdentity false
        }
    }

    override fun takeScreenshot(): Bitmap? {
        return try {
            screenViewer.capture()
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            Timber.e(e, "Failed to take screenshot")
            null
        }
    }
}

inline fun <R> runWithOriginalIdentity(action: () -> R): R {
    Binder.clearCallingIdentity()
    val identity = Binder.clearCallingIdentity()
    try {
        return action()
    } finally {
        Binder.restoreCallingIdentity(identity)
    }
}
```

Not all functionality is directly available using the platform `Accessibility APIs`. For instance, `DevicePolicyManager` is used to grant runtime permissions & `MediaProjector` for device-wide screenshots.

```kotlin:AppPermissioner.kt
class AppPermissioner(
    private val appContext: Context,
    private val devicePolicyManager: DevicePolicyManager
    private val adminComponent: ComponentName
) {

    @TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.M)
    fun grantRuntimePermissionAsUser(packageName: String, permission: String, userHandle: UserHandle) {
        devicePolicyManager.setPermissionGrantState(
            adminComponent,
            packageName,
            permission,
            PERMISSION_GRANT_STATE_GRANTED
        )
    }

    @TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.M)
    fun revokeRuntimePermissionAsUser(packageName: String, permission: String, userHandle: UserHandle) {
        devicePolicyManager.setPermissionGrantState(
            adminComponent,
            packageName,
            permission,
            PERMISSION_GRANT_STATE_DEFAULT
        )
    }
}
```
```kotlin:title=Screenshot.kt

            }
        }, backgroundHandler)

        try {
            countDownLatch.await(SCREENSHOT_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
        } finally {
            virtualDisplay.release()
        }

        return bitmap
    }
}

@WorkerThread
private fun Image.getBitmap(displayProps: DisplayProperties): Bitmap {
    val buffer: ByteBuffer = planes.first().buffer
    val pixelStride = planes.first().pixelStride
    val rowStride = planes.first().rowStride
    val rowPadding = rowStride - pixelStride * displayProps.width

    val bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(
        displayProps.width + (rowPadding.toFloat() / pixelStride.toFloat()).toInt(),
        displayProps.height,
        Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888
    )

    bitmap.copyPixelsFromBuffer(buffer)
    return bitmap
}
```

A custom class with the exact set of functions is used as a drop-in replacement for `UiAutomation`. Client test code either has to use this custom class directly or use a Gradle plugin that changes the `import` using bytecode manipulation.

> The AccessibilityService runs in a dedicated process to isolate it from the work runner app. Also, we use a proxy service to communicate with the AccessibilityService because onBind is final.

## 4. 🕹️ TestServer

Once the **AppUnderTest.apk** and **Test.apk** has been installed, the `TestServer` calls the `Context.startInstrumentation` function to run the test cases.

```java:title=android.content.Context
    /**
     * Start executing an {@link android.app.Instrumentation} class.  The given
     * Instrumentation component will be run by killing its target application
     * (if currently running), starting the target process, instantiating the
     * instrumentation component, and then letting it drive the application.
     *
     * <p>This function is not synchronous -- it returns as soon as the
     * instrumentation has started and while it is running.
     *
     * <p>Instrumentation is normally only allowed to run against a package
     * that is either unsigned or signed with a signature that the
     * the instrumentation package is also signed with (ensuring the target
     * trusts the instrumentation).
     *
     * @param className Name of the Instrumentation component to be run.
     * @param profileFile Optional path to write profiling data as the
     * instrumentation runs, or null for no profiling.
     * @param arguments Additional optional arguments to pass to the
     * instrumentation, or null.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the instrumentation was successfully started,
     * else {@code false} if it could not be found.
     */
    public abstract boolean startInstrumentation(@NonNull ComponentName className,
            @Nullable String profileFile, @Nullable Bundle arguments);
```

For the arguments parameter, a `Bundle` is populated with configuration details from the server.

```kotlin:title=TestConfigs.kt
class TestConfigs(private val arguments: Bundle) {

    fun isObscureWindowEnabled() = arguments.getBoolean(ARG_OBSCURE_WINDOW_ENABLED)

    fun shouldRetrieveTestFiles() = arguments.getBoolean(ARG_RETRIEVE_TEST_FILES)

    fun shouldRetrieveAppFiles() = arguments.getBoolean(ARG_RETRIEVE_APP_FILES)

    fun getTestsCount() = arguments.getInt(ARG_TESTS_COUNT)

    fun getProfilerSampleFrequency() = arguments.getInt(ARG_PROFILER_SAMPLE_FREQUENCY)

    fun isClearDataEnabled() = arguments.getBoolean(ARG_CLEAR_DATA)

    fun isAutoScreenShotEnabled() = arguments.getBoolean(ARG_AUTO_SCREEN_SHOT_ENABLED)

    fun getAutoScreenShotFps() = arguments.getInt(ARG_AUTO_SCREEN_SHOT_FPS)

    fun getScreenShotQuality() = arguments.getInt(ARG_AUTO_SCREEN_QUALITY)
}
```

`TestObserver.aidl` is defined for `TestClient` &lt;&gt; `TestServer` communication.

```kt:title=TestCallback.aidl
interface TestCallback {

    void onTestRunStarted(in TestDescription description);

    void onTestRunFinished(in TestResult result);

    void onTestStarted(
        in TestDescription description,
        String logFileName,
        String profilerFileName,
        String autoScreenShotNamePrefix
    );

    void onTestFinished(in TestDescription description);

    void onTestFailure(in TestFailure failure);

    void onTestAssumptionFailure(in TestFailure failure);

    void onTestIgnored(in TestDescription description);

    void onProcessCrashed(in TestDescription failure, String stackTrace);

    void onClientConnected(Finisher finisher);

    void onInterrupted(int reasonId);

    void sendString(String message);
}
```

### 4.1. 💾 Remote Storage

Logs and other artifacts need to be "streamed" to the `TestServer`. This data needs to be stored in the server's private directory but the Android security model doesn't allow foreign apps to write directly into an app's private directories. This limitation can be circumvented using a `ContentProvider` and `FileDescriptors`.

```kt:title=RemoteStorageConstants.kt
object RemoteStorageConstants {

    const val PREFIX_CONTENT = "content://"
    const val AUTHORITY = "com.fluentbuild.apollo.runtime.remotestorage"
    const val BASE_URI = "${PREFIX_CONTENT}${AUTHORITY}/"

    const val MODE_READ = "r"
    const val MODE_WRITE = "w"
    const val MODE_APPEND = "wa"
}
```
```kt:title=RemoteStorageProvider.kt
private const val REMOTE_STORAGE_DIR = "stash"

class RemoteStorageProvider: ContentProvider() {

    override fun openFile(uri: Uri, mode: String): ParcelFileDescriptor? {
        val child = uri.toString().substringAfter(RemoteStorageConstants.BASE_URI)
        if(child.isBlank()) return null

        return try {
            File(getDir(context!!), child).run {
                Timber.i("Opening file: %s with mode: %s", absolutePath, mode)
                parentFile?.mkdirs()
                openParcelFileDescriptor(mode)
            }
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            null
        }
    }

    companion object {

        fun getDir(context: Context) = File(context.filesDir, REMOTE_STORAGE_DIR).apply { mkdirs() }
    }
}
```

## 5. 🧫 TestClient

The `TestClient` is included in the **Test.apk** and controls test execution. It is part of the `"com.fluentbuild.apollo:client:version"` artifact.

```kt:title=TestClient.kt
private const val LOG_TAG = "TestClient"
private const val RUNNER_PACKAGE = "com.fluentbuild.apollo"
private const val RUNNER_SERVICE = "com.fluentbuild.apollo.RunnerService"
private const val SERVICE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MILLIS = 10_000L

/**
 * For the current instrumentation to communicate information back to the RuntimeService.
 *
 */
class TestClient(
    private val instrumentation: Instrumentation,
    private val clientFinalizer: ClientFinalizer,
    private val logWrapper: LogWrapper
): WorkInterruptCallback {

    private val connectionLatch = CountDownLatch(1)

    @Volatile
    private lateinit var testCallback: TestCallback

    private val serviceConnection = object : ServiceConnection {

        override fun onServiceConnected(className: ComponentName, service: IBinder) {
            logWrapper.i(LOG_TAG, "TestClient connected to runner service")
            testCallback = TestCallback.Stub.asInterface(service)
            connectionLatch.countDown()
        }

        override fun onServiceDisconnected(className: ComponentName) {
            logWrapper.e(LOG_TAG, "TestClient is disconnected from runner service")
            instrumentation.finishInstrumentation(Activity.RESULT_CANCELED)
        }
    }

    // Called on the test thread
    fun connect() {
        logWrapper.i(LOG_TAG, "Connecting to runner service")

        val intent = Intent()
        intent.setClassName(RUNNER_PACKAGE, RUNNER_SERVICE)

        instrumentation.context.requireServiceBind(intent, serviceConnection)

        if(!connectionLatch.await(SERVICE_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MILLIS, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)) {
            unbindService()
            throw TimeoutException("Couldn't connect to runner service")
        }

        onClientConnected()
    }

    private fun onClientConnected() {
        try {
            testCallback.onClientConnected(object : Finisher.Stub() {

                override fun finish(resultCode: Int) {
                    logWrapper.i(LOG_TAG, "Instrumentation finish requested")
                    clientFinalizer.finalize()
                    instrumentation.finishInstrumentation(resultCode)
                }
            })
        } catch (e: RemoteException) {
            handleRemoteFailure("Unable to notify runner service of connection!", e)
        }
    }

    @MainThread
    fun disconnect() {
        unbindService()
    }

    // Just simple test callbacks below
}
```

`TestClient` works in tandem with an instance of `Instrumentation`. A custom instance is required to be able to intercept `Instrumentation` callbacks. In the `"com.fluentbuild.apollo:client:version"` artifact, an implementation that subclasses `AndroidJUnitRunner` is provided. A reflection hack is used to register a `org.junit.runner.notification.RunListener` in `AndroidJUnitRunner`.

`TestClient` works in tandem with an instance of `Instrumentation`. A custom instance is required to be able to intercept `Instrumentation` callbacks. In the `"com.fluentbuild.apollo:client:version"` artifact, an implementation that subclasses `AndroidJUnitRunner` is provided. In this implementation, I used a reflection hack to hook into the `InstrumentationResultPrinter`. Passing in the `TestObserver`, which captures test states and eventually calls into the real printer.

```kt
private fun init(testConfigs: TestConfigs) {
    val printerField = getPrinterField()
    val printer = printerField.get(runner) as InstrumentationResultPrinter
    initializer.init(testConfigs, printer)
    printerField.set(runner, initializer.getTestObserver())
}

private fun getPrinterField(): Field {
    return AndroidJUnitRunner::class.java.getDeclaredField("instrumentationResultPrinter")
        .apply { isAccessible = true }
}
```

For publishers that don't use `AndroidJunitRunner`, they can still use the client artifact by calling into the relevant functions.

#### 5.2. 🔐 Runtime Permissions

`UiAutomation` can be used to request runtime permission. An extra layer similar to the one in the `androidx.test.runner.permission` package can be created to simplify this flow.

```kotlin:title=PermissionGranter.kt
/**
 * Requests a runtime permission on devices running Android M (API 23) and above.
 *
 * This class is usually used to grant runtime permissions to avoid the permission dialog from
 * showing up and blocking the App's Ui. This is especially helpful for Ui-Testing to avoid loosing
 * control over your application under test.
 *
 * The requested permissions will be granted for all test methods in the test class. Use [addPermissions] to add a permission to the permission list. To request all
 * permissions use the [requestPermissions] method.
 *
 */
interface PermissionGranter {

    /**
     * Adds a permission to the list of permissions which will be requested when [.requestPermissions] is called.
     *
     * Precondition: This method does nothing when called on an API level lower than [Build.VERSION_CODES.M].
     *
     * @param permissions a list of Android runtime permissions.
     */
    fun addPermissions(vararg permissions: String)

    /**
     * Request all permissions previously added using [.addPermissions]
     *
     * Precondition: This method does nothing when called on an API level lower than [ ][Build.VERSION_CODES.M].
     */
    fun requestPermissions()
}
```

#### 5.3. 🔬 Components Monitor

The components of the **AppUnderTest** are closely monitored to power some telemetry functionalities. For each type of component, we create an implementation of the `Monitor` interface.

```kt:title=Monitor.kt
abstract class Monitor<CallbackT> {

    protected val callbacks = mutableListOf<WeakReference<CallbackT>>()

    internal fun registerCallback(callback: CallbackT) {
        if(callbacks.none { it.get() == callback }) {
            callbacks += WeakReference(callback)
        }
    }

    internal fun unregisterCallback(callback: CallbackT) {
        callbacks.removeAll { it.get() == callback }
    }
}
```

`AppMonitor` monitors the `Application` lifecycle.

```kt:title=AppMonitor.kt
class AppMonitor: Monitor<AppMonitor.Callback>() {

    private var appRef: WeakReference<Application>? = null

    private fun signalLifecycleChange(application: Application, stage: ApplicationStats.Stage) {
        callbacks.forEach { it.get()?.onStageChanged(application, stage) }
    }

    fun onCallApplicationOnCreate(app: Application, action: () -> Unit) {
        appRef = WeakReference(app)
        signalLifecycleChange(app, ApplicationStats.Stage.PRE_ON_CREATE)
        action()
        signalLifecycleChange(app, ApplicationStats.Stage.CREATED)
    }

    fun getActiveApp(): Application? = appRef?.get()

    interface Callback {
        fun onStageChanged(app: Application, stage: ApplicationStats.Stage)
    }
}
```

`ActivityMonitor` monitors the lifecycle of all activities in the **AppUnderTest**. The action function allows the monitor control when the caller (the Instrumentation) can pass the event downstream.

```kt:title=ActivityMonitor.kt
class ActivityMonitor: Monitor<ActivityMonitor.Callback>() {

    private val activeActivities = WeakHashMap<Activity, ActivityStats.Stage>()

    private fun signalLifecycleChange(activity: Activity, stage: ActivityStats.Stage) {
        activeActivities[activity] = stage
        callbacks.forEach {
            it.get()?.onStageChanged(activity, stage)
        }
    }

    fun onCallActivityOnDestroy(activity: Activity, action: () -> Unit) {
        signalLifecycleChange(activity, ActivityStats.Stage.DESTROYED)
        action()
        activeActivities.remove(activity)
    }

    fun onCallActivityOnRestart(activity: Activity, action: () -> Unit) {
        action()
        signalLifecycleChange(activity, ActivityStats.Stage.RESTARTED)
    }

    fun onCallActivityOnCreate(activity: Activity, bundle: Bundle?, action: () -> Unit) {
        signalLifecycleChange(activity, ActivityStats.Stage.PRE_ON_CREATE)
        action()
        signalLifecycleChange(activity, ActivityStats.Stage.CREATED)
    }

    fun onCallActivityOnCreate(
        activity: Activity,
        bundle: Bundle?,
        persistentState: PersistableBundle,
        action: () -> Unit
    ) {
        signalLifecycleChange(activity, ActivityStats.Stage.PRE_ON_CREATE)
        action()
        signalLifecycleChange(activity, ActivityStats.Stage.CREATED)
    }

    fun onCallActivityOnStart(activity: Activity, action: () -> Unit) {
        action()
        signalLifecycleChange(activity, ActivityStats.Stage.STARTED)
    }

    fun onCallActivityOnStop(activity: Activity, action: () -> Unit) {
        action()
        signalLifecycleChange(activity, ActivityStats.Stage.STOPPED)
    }

    fun onCallActivityOnResume(activity: Activity, action: () -> Unit) {
        action()
        signalLifecycleChange(activity, ActivityStats.Stage.RESUMED)
    }

    fun onCallActivityOnPause(activity: Activity, action: () -> Unit) {
        action()
        signalLifecycleChange(activity, ActivityStats.Stage.PAUSED)
    }
    
    fun getActiveActivities(): Set<Activity>  {
        return activeActivities.keys
    }

    interface Callback {
        fun onStageChanged(activity: Activity, stage: ActivityStats.Stage)
    }
}
```

### 5.4. 🔂 JUnit

Only `Parcelable` classes can be used in AIDL IPC calls. Because of this constraint, the following model classes were created to pass notifications from JUnit to the server.

```kotlin:title=Models.kt
data class TestDescription(
    val className: String,
    val methodName: String?,
    val displayName: String
): Parcelable

data class TestFailure(
    val description: TestDescription,
    val trace: String
): Parcelable

data class TestResult(
    val runtimeMillis: Long,
    val ignoreCount: Int,
    val failures: List<TestFailure>
): Parcelable
```

The jUnit models will need to be mapped to the model classes defined above.

```kotlin:title=ModelsMapper.kt
private const val MAX_TRACE_SIZE = 64 * 1024

internal fun Description.createTestModel(): TestDescription {
    return TestDescription(className, methodName, displayName)
}

internal fun Failure.createTestModel(): TestFailure {
    var stackTrace = trace

    if (stackTrace.length > MAX_TRACE_SIZE) {
        // Since we report failures back to the runtime via a binder IPC, we need to make sure that
        // we don't exceed the Binder transaction limit - which is 1MB per process.
        Log.w(LOG_TAG, "Stack trace too long, trimmed to first $MAX_TRACE_SIZE characters.")
        stackTrace = trace.substring(0, MAX_TRACE_SIZE) + "\n"
    }

    return TestFailure(description.createTestModel(), stackTrace)
}

internal fun Result.createTestModel(): TestResult {
    return TestResult(runTime, ignoreCount, failures.map { it.createTestModel() })
}
```

The `TestObserver` is an instance of `org.junit.runner.notification.RunListener`, and is notified of events that occur during a test run. These events are passed to the `TestClient` which then passes it to the `TestServer`.

```kt:title=TestObserver.kt
internal class TestObserver(
    private val testClient: TestClient,
    private val wrappedPrinter: InstrumentationResultPrinter,
    private val clientFinalizer: ClientFinalizer,
    private val collatorsManager: CollatorsManager
): InstrumentationResultPrinter() {

    private var startedCount = 0
    private var lastStartedTest: Description? = null

    override fun testRunStarted(description: Description) {
        testClient.testRunStarted(description)
        wrappedPrinter.testRunStarted(description)
    }

    override fun testStarted(description: Description) {
        lastStartedTest = description
        startedCount++
        testClient.testStarted(description, collatorsManager.getInfo())
        wrappedPrinter.testStarted(description)
    }

    override fun testAssumptionFailure(failure: Failure) {
        testClient.testAssumptionFailure(failure)
        restartMeasurement()
        wrappedPrinter.testAssumptionFailure(failure)
    }

    override fun testRunFinished(result: Result) {
        testClient.testRunFinished(result)
        wrappedPrinter.testRunFinished(result)
    }

    override fun sendString(msg: String) {
        testClient.sendString(msg)
        wrappedPrinter.sendString(msg)
    }

    override fun instrumentationRunFinished(
        summaryWriter: PrintStream,
        resultBundle: Bundle,
        junitResults: Result
    ) {
        clientFinalizer.finalize()
        wrappedPrinter.instrumentationRunFinished(summaryWriter, resultBundle, junitResults)
    }

    override fun testFailure(failure: Failure) {
        testClient.testFailure(failure)
        restartMeasurement()
        wrappedPrinter.testFailure(failure)
    }

    override fun testFinished(description: Description) {
        testClient.testFinished(description)
        restartMeasurement()
        wrappedPrinter.testFinished(description)
    }

    override fun testIgnored(description: Description) {
        testClient.testIgnored(description)
        restartMeasurement()
        wrappedPrinter.testIgnored(description)
    }

    override fun reportProcessCrash(throwable: Throwable) {
        testClient.processCrashed(Failure(lastStartedTest, throwable))
        restartMeasurement()
        wrappedPrinter.reportProcessCrash(throwable)
    }

    private fun restartMeasurement() {
        collatorsManager.restart()
    }
}
```

### 5.5. 👀 Obscuring Screen

`OverlayView` is a simple custom fullscreen opaque view that is used to obscure Activities when requested. The overlay is attached to the window immediately after an Activity is created. I haven't noticed any interferences yet between the overlay and test UI interactions.

```kotlin:title=WindowOverlay.kt
internal class WindowOverlay(activity: Activity) {

    private val overlayView = OverlayView(activity)

    init {
        activity.window.addContentView(overlayView.rootView, getWindowParams())
    }

    fun updateLabel(labelText: String) {
        overlayView.updateLabel(labelText)
    }

    fun getRoot() = overlayView.rootView

    private fun getWindowParams(): WindowManager.LayoutParams {
        val type = if(AndroidVersion.isAtLeastOreo()) {
            WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY
        } else {
            @Suppress("DEPRECATION")
            WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_PHONE
        }

        val formats = WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE or
                WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_NOT_FOCUSABLE or
                WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON or
                WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_FULLSCREEN

        return WindowManager.LayoutParams(
            WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,
            WindowManager.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,
            type,
            formats,
            PixelFormat.TRANSPARENT
        )
    }
}
```

### 5.5. 🤏 User Interrupts

Any external interactions should immediately stop test execution to prevent interference. The `NavigationInteractionObserver` detects when a user presses a button.

```kotlin:title=NavigationInteractionObserver.kt
private const val SYSTEM_DIALOG_REASON_KEY = "reason"
private const val SYSTEM_DIALOG_REASON_GLOBAL_ACTIONS = "globalactions"
private const val SYSTEM_DIALOG_REASON_RECENT_APPS = "recentapps"
private const val SYSTEM_DIALOG_REASON_HOME_KEY = "homekey"

internal class NavigationInteractionObserver(private val callback: Callback): BroadcastReceiver() {

    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        val reason = intent.getStringExtra(SYSTEM_DIALOG_REASON_KEY)

        if (reason == SYSTEM_DIALOG_REASON_HOME_KEY) {
            callback.onHomePressed()
        } else if (reason == SYSTEM_DIALOG_REASON_RECENT_APPS) {
            callback.onRecentAppsPressed()
        }
    }

    fun start(context: Context) {
        context.registerReceiver(this, IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_CLOSE_SYSTEM_DIALOGS))
    }

    fun stop(context: Context) {
        context.unregisterReceiver(this)
    }

    interface Callback {

        fun onHomePressed()

        fun onRecentAppsPressed()
    }
}
```

The `WindowInteractionObserver` detects when a user taps on the screen.

```kotlin:title=WindowInteractionObserver.kt
internal class WindowInteractionObserver(private val callback: Callback): ActivityMonitor.Callback {

    override fun onStageChanged(activity: Activity, stage: ActivityStats.Stage) {
        if(stage == ActivityStats.Stage.CREATED) {
            activity.window.callback = object: WindowCallbackWrapper(activity.window.callback) {

                override fun dispatchTouchEvent(event: MotionEvent): Boolean {
                    evaluateUserMotion(event)
                    return super.dispatchTouchEvent(event)
                }

                override fun dispatchKeyEvent(event: KeyEvent): Boolean {
                    evaluateUserKeyInput(event)
                    return super.dispatchKeyEvent(event)
                }
            }
        }
    }

    interface Callback {

        fun onWindowTouchedByUser()

        fun onKeyPressedByUser()
    }
}
```

### 5.7. 💾 Remote Storage

The client can utilize the server's ContentProvider to save files in the server's private directory.

```kt:title=FileDescriptorProvider.kt
class FileDescriptorProvider(private val context: Context) {

    @Throws(Exception::class)
    internal fun getReadableDescriptor(fileName: String) = getDescriptor(fileName, MODE_READ)

    @Throws(Exception::class)
    internal fun getWritableDescriptor(fileName: String) = getDescriptor(fileName, MODE_WRITE)

    @Throws(Exception::class)
    internal fun getAppendableDescriptor(fileName: String) = getDescriptor(fileName, MODE_APPEND)

    @Throws(Exception::class)

### 5.8. 🧹 Finalizing

After running all tests or when the **AppUnderTest** crashes, all miscellaneous artifacts are moved to the `TestServer`.

```kt:title=ArtifactsCopier.kt
class ArtifactsCopier(
    private val targetContext: Context,
    private val instrumentationContext: Context,
    private val testConfigs: TestConfigs,
) {

    fun copy() {
        if (testConfigs.shouldRetrieveTestFiles()) {
            copyDir(destinationDir = "test_files", sourceDir = instrumentationContext.filesDir)
        }

        if (testConfigs.shouldRetrieveAppFiles()) {
            copyDir(destinationDir = "app_files", sourceDir = targetContext.filesDir)
        }
    }
}
```

```kotlin:title=ClearDataTask.kt
internal class ClearDataTask(private val targetContext: Context): Task {

    override fun run() {
        targetContext.externalMediaDirs.forEach { it?.deleteRecursively() }
        targetContext.noBackupFilesDir.deleteRecursively()

        targetContext.cacheDir.deleteRecursively()
        targetContext.codeCacheDir.deleteRecursively()
        targetContext.externalCacheDir?.deleteRecursively()

        targetContext.filesDir.deleteRecursively()
        if(AndroidVersion.isAtLeastNougat()) {
            targetContext.dataDir.deleteRecursively()
        } else {
            targetContext.filesDir.parentFile?.deleteRecursively()
        }
    }
}
```

### 5.9. ❌ Cancelling

When an error occurs transmitting test state, or when the server connection is broken, the client automatically cancels all executions. The server can also cancel the client using the `Finisher` interface.

```java:title=Finisher.aidl
interface Finisher {
    void finish(int resultCode);
}
```

When the connection to the client is severed, the server uses the `CancelSignalObserver` in a last-ditch effort to terminate the client. The `CancelSignalObserver` is a `BroadcastReceiver` that is tied to the lifecycle of the test process.

```kt:title=CancelSignalObserver.kt
class CancelSignalObserver(private val instrumentation: Instrumentation): BroadcastReceiver() {

    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        if(intent.action == ACTION_CANCEL_SIGNAL) {
            instrumentation.finishInstrumentation(Activity.RESULT_CANCELED)
        }
    }

    fun start() {
        instrumentation.targetContext.registerReceiver(
            this,
            IntentFilter(ACTION_CANCEL_SIGNAL)
        )
    }

    fun stop() {
        instrumentation.targetContext.unregisterReceiver(this)
    }
}
```

### 6. ⏱️ Telemetry

While tests are running, performance & device health data is periodically collated and stored. Protocol buffers are used for data serialization.

### 6.1. 🌴 Logs

The `logcat` process is used to capture logs. The `logcat` input stream is piped to a file on the TestServer's remote storage. While logcat can directly write to a file, it can't write to the TestServer's private directory.

```kotlin:title=LogTunnel.kt
private const val CMD_CLEAR_LOGCAT_BUFFERS = "logcat -b all -c"
private const val CMD_START_LOGCAT = "logcat -b all -v threadtime,epoch,printable --dividers"

class LogTunnel {

    fun start(sink: File) {
        Thread {
            getRuntime().exec(CMD_CLEAR_LOGCAT_BUFFERS)
            val logcat = getRuntime().exec(CMD_START_LOGCAT)

            val sinkFileDescriptor = fileProvider.getAppendableFileDescriptor(sinkFileName)
            logcat.inputStream.pipe(sinkFileDescriptor)
        }.apply {
            name = "LoggerThread"
            start()
        }
    }
}
```

> This approach might be problematic if there is ever a need for external logs. Starting from Jellybean, the logs from external apps can't be read.

### 6.2. 📷 Screenshots

Three strategies are employed to take a screenshot of the app:

1. [PixelCopy](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/PixelCopy)
2. Drawing the window decor view to a canvas. This strategy can't capture dialogs or other windows.
3. Using reflection to get all relevant windows and draw them to a canvas. This captures dialogs and other elements.

The best strategy is picked and used during runtime.

```kt:title=ScreenShotterFactory.kt
class ScreenShotterFactory(
    private val screenshotHandler: Handler
) {

    fun createOrderedBestShotters(): Set<ScreenShotter> {
        val shotters = mutableSetOf<ScreenShotter>()

        if(AndroidVersion.isAtLeastOreo()) {
            shotters += WindowScreenShotter(screenshotHandler)
        }

        shotters += ReflectionScreenShotter(screenshotHandler)
        shotters += RootViewScreenShotter(screenshotHandler)
        return shotters
    }

    fun createBestShotter() = createOrderedBestShotters().first()
}
```

## 7. 🏃 Worker & WorkRunner

The `WorkRunner` sits at the heart of DART. Once the user clicks the start button, the `Worker` notifies the gRPC server that it is now available for work. The worker includes its current hardware and software states in the request. This information allows the gRPC server to match a worker to the right job at the right time. For instance, a worker won't receive work if it's hot.

The work object contains details about the work to run and what configurations to use.

```protobuf:title=Work.proto

    /**
     * Unique key of the given work.
