Note: There has been controversy regarding the data used to identify blue zones and the findings in this study. Advisable to read those before/after. See: [Blue Zones Diet: Speculation Based on Misinformation](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/blue-zones-diet-speculation-based-on-misinformation/)

1. Blue zones: 5 places around the world where people consistently live over 100 years old.
2. The 5 Blue Zones:
  *   Okinawa, Japan
  *   Sardinia, Italy
  *   Nicoya, Costa Rica
  *   Ikaria, Greece
  *   Loma Linda, California, USA
3. [The Danish Twin Study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02185763) established that only about `20%` of how long the average person lives is dictated by our **genes**, whereas the other `80%` is dictated by our **lifestyle**.
4. The lifestyles of all Blue Zones residents shared 9 specific characteristics:
    * Moderate & regular physical activity
    * Life purpose
    * Stress reduction
    * Moderate caloric intake
    * Plant-based diet
    * Moderate alcohol intake, especially wine
    * Engagement in spirituality or religion
    * Engagement in family life
    * Engagement in social life
